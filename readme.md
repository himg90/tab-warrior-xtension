## Introduction

Many of us often find ourselves overwhelmed with numerous open Chrome tabs, making it challenging to distinguish the relevant ones from the rest. While Chrome offers a helpful feature to organize tabs into meaningful groups called TabGroups, managing these groups manually can be cumbersome.

Introducing our Chrome extension, designed to streamline this process. This extension automates the organization of tabs by grouping them together when opened through links in other tabs. As you close tabs, the extension dynamically manages TabGroups â€“ automatically deleting a TabGroup if it contains only one remaining tab. Enjoy a more efficient and hassle-free tab management experience with our extension.
